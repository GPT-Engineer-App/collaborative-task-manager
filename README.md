# collaborative-task-manager

I want you to guide me through setting up an SPA for my MVP. I want you to envision three complete SPA's. Select the most feasable one given the useability of the designated functions.
The following information is a pointer towards what values should be conveyed but you are free to interpret how it aligns with your capabilities and prefered implementation.
The purpose is to maximize the equations so that the user has the highest value.

def calculate_effectiveness(successful_tasks, total_tasks):
    if total_tasks == 0:
        return 0
    return (successful_tasks / total_tasks) * 100

# Example usage
successful_tasks = 45
total_tasks = 50
effectiveness = calculate_effectiveness(successful_tasks, total_tasks)
print("Effectiveness:", effectiveness, "%")


def calculate_efficiency(total_task_time, successful_tasks):
    if successful_tasks == 0:
        return float('inf')  # Indicate inefficiency
    return total_task_time / successful_tasks

# Example usage
total_task_time = 120  # in minutes
successful_tasks = 45
efficiency = calculate_efficiency(total_task_time, successful_tasks)
print("Efficiency:", efficiency, "minutes/task")




def calculate_satisfaction(satisfaction_scores):
    if len(satisfaction_scores) == 0:
        return 0
    return sum(satisfaction_scores) / len(satisfaction_scores)

# Example usage
satisfaction_scores = [4, 5, 3, 4, 5]  # Ratings out of 5
satisfaction = calculate_satisfaction(satisfaction_scores)
print("Satisfaction:", satisfaction, "/ 5")



def calculate_error_rate(errors, total_interactions):
    if total_interactions == 0:
        return 0
    return errors / total_interactions

# Example usage
errors = 5
total_interactions = 500
error_rate = calculate_error_rate(errors, total_interactions)
print("Error Rate:", error_rate)




def calculate_learnability(time_to_proficiency, training_sessions):
    if training_sessions == 0:
        return float('inf')  # Indicate high difficulty in learning
    return time_to_proficiency / training_sessions

# Example usage
time_to_proficiency = 30  # in hours
training_sessions = 5
learnability = calculate_learnability(time_to_proficiency, training_sessions)
print("Learnability:", learnability, "hours/session")
